Here you will apply the variational principle to the H atom.  For this problem it is easiest to work in atomic units.  In these units, $\\hbar$, $a_0$, and $4\\pi\\epsilon_0$ are all equal to 1 and the unit of energy is the Hartree, equivalent to 27.212 eV.  In atomic units the H atom Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation is written:\n",
