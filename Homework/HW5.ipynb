Again taking each C—C bond as 1.4 Å long and treating the π electrons as particles in a box, calculate the total energy of an ethylene and a butadiene molecule within this model (in kJ/mol), and from these calculate the net reaction energy. Compare your results to the experimental reaction enthalpy. How well did the model do?"
